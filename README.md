Multiple Regression

1. I have choosen a file containing information on 383 automobiles marketed in the United States between 1970 and 1982. The variables included MPG
(miles per gallon), Cylinders (of the engine), Cubic Inches (engine displacement), Horsepower, Weight (in pounds), Model Year, Country of Origin, Auto Make, and Auto Model.
2. I have taken a random sample of 100 automobiles from the master data set.  This will be the primary data set.  It will have the following characteristics.
a.The Model Year and Cylinders variables will have been converted to factors.
b. Only autos with Model Year of 1976 and earlier will be included.
3. Then I have conducted a multiple regression analysis using the primary data set.  Using MPG as the dependent variable and Cubic Inches, Horsepower, and Weight as independent variables.
4. Then I have  determined whether the model appears to be in conformity with the LINE assumptions of regression or not.
5. Using your multiple regression model from Part 3 above, I have introduced the Cylinders variable into the model.  Reset the levels of the Cylinders variable such that “8” is the base case.
